# Question

What are the steps to incorporating context into your application?

# Answer
Import createContext from react, then create a new context object. Next, wrap the components that use the context values in the Provider to makes the context available to all components within the provider. Then, set the `value` prop and remove the prop drilling. Import the useContext from react and the name of created context, which would be invoked by useContext.
