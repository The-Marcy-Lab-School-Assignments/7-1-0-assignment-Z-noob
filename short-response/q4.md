# Question

Consider this `InstagramContextProvider` component below.

**Question:** When using the "Global Context Provider" pattern, what will the `children` be? In other words, what component will this `InstagramContextProvider` be wrapped around?

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import InstagramContext from "./InstagramContext";

const InstagramContextProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [totalLikes, setTotalLikes] = useState(0);
  const incrementTotalLikes = () => setTotalLikes(totalLikes + 1);

  const contextValues = { totalLikes, incrementTotalLikes };

  return (
    <InstagramContext.Provider value={contextValues}>
      {children}
    </InstagramContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default InstagramContextProvider;
```


# Answer
The children is going to be the component that uses the value provided, which is totalLikes and incrementTotalLikes in this case.
All descendants of children also has access to the contextValues that we choose.

Your answer is partially correct. While it's true that the children component will use the provided values, if we're aiming to make the context global, the InstagramContextProvider should be wrapped around the <App /> component. This ensures that all components within the app can access the contextValues, not just the descendants of a specific component.
