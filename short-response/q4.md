# Question

Consider this `InstagramContextProvider` component below.

**Question:** When using the "Global Context Provider" pattern, what will the `children` be? In other words, what component will this `InstagramContextProvider` be wrapped around?

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import InstagramContext from "./InstagramContext";

const InstagramContextProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [totalLikes, setTotalLikes] = useState(0);
  const incrementTotalLikes = () => setTotalLikes(totalLikes + 1);

  const contextValues = { totalLikes, incrementTotalLikes };

  return (
    <InstagramContext.Provider value={contextValues}>
      {children}
    </InstagramContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default InstagramContextProvider;
```


# Answer
The children is going to be the component that uses the value provided, which is totalLikes and incrementTotalLikes in this case.
All descendants of children also has access to the contextValues that we choose.
